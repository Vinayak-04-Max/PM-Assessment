# Weather Trend Forecasting

This project analyzes global weather data to forecast temperature trends and uncover meaningful climate insights using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal is to perform time series forecasting and advanced analysis using global weather data, covering over 200 cities. The project involves:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Time Series Forecasting  
- Advanced climate pattern analysis  
- Model evaluation and ensemble techniques  

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- Machine Learning: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM  
- Ensemble Methods  
- Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib  
- Notebook: Google Colab  

## Forecasting Models

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)  
- Prophet (Facebook's time series forecasting library)  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)  
- Ensemble (Averaged predictions of the above models)
