##Weather Trend Forecasting

This project analyzes global weather data to forecast temperature trends and uncover meaningful climate insights using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

#Project Overview

The goal is to perform time series forecasting and advanced analysis using global weather data, covering over 200 cities. The project involves:

-Data preprocessing and cleaning

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Time Series Forecasting

-Advanced climate pattern analysis

-Model evaluation and ensemble techniques


#Technologies Used

-Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

-Machine Learning: ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM

-Ensemble Methods

-Visualization: Plotly, Matplotlib

-Notebook: Google Colab


#Forecasting Models

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

-ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

-Prophet (Facebook's time series forecasting library)

-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)

-Ensemble (Averaged predictions of above models)



How to Run

1. Clone the repository

2. Open notebook.ipynb in Google Colab

3. Run all cells step by step to replicate the results



Results Summary

The ensemble model achieved improved performance by combining individual model predictions. Key metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) are documented in the report.
